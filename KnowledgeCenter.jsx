## What is a Threat Level?

The Threat Level is a simple, color-coded indicator showing how dangerous the current security situation is for your organization.

## How We Calculate It

Outpost Zero's AI analyzes thousands of factors:
- Active attacks targeting your industry
- Vulnerabilities in your systems
- Suspicious activities detected
- Global threat intelligence
- Historical attack patterns

## The Four Threat Levels

### 🟢 Green (Low)
**What it means**: Normal operations, no active threats detected.

**What to do**:
- Continue routine monitoring
- Review security metrics weekly
- Maintain standard security practices

### 🟡 Yellow (Medium)
**What it means**: Potential threats detected, increased vigilance recommended.

**What to do**:
- Review recent security events
- Check for unpatched vulnerabilities
- Verify backup systems are functioning
- Brief security team on elevated risk

### 🟠 Orange (High)
**What it means**: Active threat campaign detected targeting organizations like yours.

**What to do**:
- Enable additional security controls
- Increase monitoring frequency
- Brief executive team
- Prepare incident response team
- Review and test disaster recovery procedures

### 🔴 Red (Critical)
**What it means**: Immediate threat to business operations, active attack detected.

**What to do**:
- Activate incident response team immediately
- Execute containment playbooks
- Notify executive leadership
- Consider activating disaster recovery procedures
- Document all actions for compliance

## Business Impact

Understanding threat levels helps you:
- Allocate resources appropriately
- Communicate risk to stakeholders
- Make informed business decisions
- Justify security investments`,

            content: `# Creating Your First SOAR Playbook

## What is a SOAR Playbook?

A SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) playbook is a predefined set of automated actions that respond to security threats.

## Step 1: Identify a Repetitive Task

Choose a security task you perform frequently:
- Responding to phishing emails
- Blocking malicious IP addresses
- Disabling compromised user accounts
- Quarantining malware

## Step 2: Access the Playbook Builder

1. Navigate to **SOAR** from the main menu
2. Click **"Create Custom Playbook"**
3. Give your playbook a descriptive name

## Step 3: Define the Trigger

Choose what starts your playbook:
- Specific event type (e.g., "Malware Detected")
- Severity level (e.g., "High" or "Critical")
- Source system (e.g., "Endpoint Detection")

## Step 4: Build the Workflow

Drag and drop actions in sequence:

**Example Phishing Response Playbook**:
1. **Analyze Email** - Extract sender, links, attachments
2. **Check Threat Intelligence** - Cross-reference against known threats
3. **Quarantine Email** - Isolate from all inboxes
4. **Block Sender** - Add to email blacklist
5. **Create Ticket** - Log in ITSM system
6. **Notify Team** - Alert security analysts

## Step 5: Test in Safe Mode

1. Enable "Test Mode"
2. Run simulation with sample data
3. Review execution logs
4. Verify expected outcomes

## Step 6: Deploy and Monitor

1. Disable "Test Mode"
2. Activate playbook
3. Monitor execution success rate
4. Iterate based on results

## Best Practices

- Start simple, add complexity over time
- Always test before deploying
- Document your playbooks
- Review and update regularly
- Use AI recommendations for optimization`,
